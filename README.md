# Functional and Logic Programming 

## Course Information:
Code: L.EIC024

Acronym: PFL

### Objetives:
- Acquire familiarity with the paradigms of Functional Programming and Logic Programming. 
- Develop abstract reasoning and problem representation skills in a declarative way.

### Learning Outcomes
- Use predefined and algebraic Haskell types to represent values from a specific domain
- Define generic transformations over inductive data structures (eg trees) as polymorphic functions in Haskell
- Decompose programming problems into pure functions in Haskell operating on structured data types
- Prove program correctness in Haskell using definitions with equations and induction
- Representing facts and relationships as programs in Prolog
- Understand the model of running programs in Prolog
- Model search problems as logic programs and queries in Prolog
