# Taktikus

## Game Rules
- Played by 2 players (white and black, respectively)
- On a 8x8 chess-like board (with no colors)
- Each player starts with 8 pieces in their first row
- Each turn a player moves one piece (let white start)
- The pieces have a rook-like movement (diagonal or horizontal as far as the player want), but cannot jump over a piece (either color)
- The objective is to capture the opponent's pieces
- Capturing occurs in 2 ways:
    1. by capturing one or more of the opponents marbles (in an unbroken row or column) between two of oneâ€™s own marbles. 
    2. moving a marble into an empty space in-between two of the opponents marbles, which are both captured.
- Game ends:
    When one player is left with 1 or less pieces on the board
